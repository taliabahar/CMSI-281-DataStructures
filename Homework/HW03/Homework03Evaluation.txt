======================

Nice work on this assignment!
Here are a couple of observations and comments:

Be careful about your naming conventions.  Always name your classes
with an upper-case letter.  This goes for the file name as well.  It
is convention to do this, there are times when the compiler will NOT
accept lovercase initial letters, and times when it will.  Also the
name of the file should match the name of the main class it contains.
To have a file named "bubbleSort.java" that contains the class named
"ArrayBub" is confusing and misleading to other programmers.

The escape codes in the Simon game don't actually work on my command
prompt in Windows 7.  You probably tested it on either windows 10 or
on a mac, right?  What I see instead is: "←[H←[2J"...

Total credit is 13 for Sorter and either Simon or Huffman
 extra credit is 7 points for other of Simon or Huffman
-------------------------
 Grand total is 20 points for all three

you got 13 out of 13 which is 100% which is an A-plus
