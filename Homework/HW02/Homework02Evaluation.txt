Homework02 Evaluation
======================

Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

Very good work!  Feel free to do a few more tests of your code in the
next assignment.  Remember you can NEVER EVER do "too much testing"...
The more tests you run, the better the chance you will find a bug, and
for these assignments, much of the test creation is just copy and paste
of existing tests!
