======================

Nice job on this assignment...
Here are a couple of observations and comments:

Your code looks great and thanks for doing headers!

These were from Nico's repo.

There are some problems.  I couldn't get the HashTableAppFolding
to work.  I used a table size of 193, an initialization of 20 items,
and when I tried to insert the value 12345 and listed the table
the values were not in there.  There was no error message.  Yet,
when I did a find, that came back with the value.  Delete seemed
to work as well, but I never saw the values in the table listing.

With HashTableApp, same parameters, I inserted the string values
"this", "is", "a", "string", "to", "hash" but when I listed the 
contents out none of the strings appeared.

You did write code, though, so I gave you 1/2 credit for it all.
